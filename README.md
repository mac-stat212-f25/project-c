# Winning Numbers: Analysis of Success Metrics in the Modern NFL

This GitHub repository contains code and resources for analyzing NFL team performance from 2018 to 2024, focusing on both offensive and defensive metrics and their relationship to team wins. To run the code, you need R version 4.5.1 or higher, RStudio version 2024.12.1 Build 563 or higher, and the R packages nflreadr, dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, rmarkdown, downlit, and xml2. Before running the code, set up your environment by installing Git and GitHub Desktop, creating a GitHub account, and cloning this repository to a local path outside cloud-synced folders. In RStudio, disable workspace restoration in the global options, install the required packages, and render the book using the Build pane to check that the website displays correctly. Use the Terminal to publish the portfolio via quarto publish gh-pages --no-browser, providing a GitHub token if prompted. The expected output includes tables summarizing team statistics by season and visualizations such as mean offensive EPA versus wins, red zone and third-down differential versus wins, turnover margin versus wins, and offensive versus defensive EPA versus wins, allowing users to explore which metrics are most strongly associated with team success.
