title: "Case Study"

The professional report we decided to study was "Making it Big" (https://pudding.cool/2017/01/making-it-big/), which explores the trajectory of bands. This report begins by explaining the data used — information from 75,000 shows in New York over three years. The report then examines bands that played at small venues, followed by medium venues, and finally big venues. It emphasizes the difficulty of “making it big” as a band. To present the data, the report uses short paragraphs for each venue size, but relies primarily on a visualization that updates as you scroll down the page. At the end, there is a final chart highlighting a select group of bands and how long it took them to achieve major success. Overall, we learned that while written descriptions of data findings are important, what truly captures a reader’s attention are visualizations—and when those visualizations can explain themselves, reader engagement and understanding improve significantly.
