    "text": "As football players at Macalester, Christian and I wondered why it seems like some football teams just can’t improve. Is it the players? The coaches? The general management? We set out to determine which team metrics were most affiliated with a team’s success over the course of a given NFL football season to find out whether this was a problem of performance or something deeper rooted.\n    First, we had to determine the metrics we would herald as the “most important” statistics for winning football games. Once we had narrowed our components down to just EPA, third downs, turnovers, and redzone differential, we compared them to a team’s total wins on a season to produce correlation coefficients for each statistic as they relate to wins. A common saying in football that we looked to verify is that “Defense wins championships.” As our findings show, empirically, there is almost no difference in correlation between wins and offense vs. wins and defense. In fact, offensive efficiency is actually slightly more correlated with wins than defensive efficiency. Somewhat surprisingly, performance in game situations like third downs and turnover margin is more important to team success than redzone differential.\n    In summary, if coaches focused on offensive efficiency through metrics like down success and emphasized performance in key metrics instead of in big plays and systems, their teams would theoretically have more success over the course of a season. It’s important to note that these are averages, and that in any given football game defense can be more important than offense and vice versa. Additionally, the game has evolved even in the last 5 years in such a manner that offensive players are more protected than defensive players, and general consensus around the NFL is that the league favors offense.",

    "text": "In football, EPA (Expected Points Added) is an advanced stat that measures how much a single play increases or decreases a team’s chance to score, considering context like down, distance, and field position, not just yards gained, helping analysts see a play’s true value beyond traditional stats\nThis exploratory data analysis investigates team-level NFL data from 2018–2024 using nflreadr/nflfastR. The goal is to examine which team statistics—such as offensive efficiency, defensive performance, and turnover margin—best relate to game success (wins). This EDA summarizes the data, checks for missingness, and provides early visual insights before building predictive models. This data originally consisted of NFL statistics ranging from 1999-2025, but given how much american football has evolved over 2 decades, it seems more appropriate to focus on statistics from 2018 to present. To explore this data, I cleaned it. Firstly filtering so stats begin during the 2018 season like mentioned, then filtering so the data only consists of regular season games. I did this to ensure each NFL franchise had a consistent amount of statistics. Using playoff stats as well could have altered the consistency, given that some franchises are more consistently good (making playoffs) and some are more consistently bad (missing playoffs). I then go onto looking at team and mean offensive EPA, which in simple terms is just how efficient and successful a team is on each given play (are they making the most of every play). Using my favorite team and my knowledge regarding their performance history, I found a strong correlation between EPA and team success. For example in 2021, the Detroit Lions lost 13 games, and only won 3; the team’s total EPA for that season was -85.239390 and the mean EPA was -0.06132330. For comparison, in 2024 the Lions won 15 games and only lost 2; the team’s total EPA for that season was 202.626047, with the mean EPA being 0.135084031. This comparison shows how strongly a team’s EPA reflects its overall success. In seasons where the Lions performed poorly, their total and mean EPA were deeply negative, indicating that the team was consistently losing value on a play-by-play basis. But in seasons where they won many more games, both their total and mean EPA were strongly positive. In short, higher EPA isn’t just a statistical improvement — it directly corresponds to better on-field performance and more wins.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ngames &lt;- load_schedules()\ngames_clean &lt;- games %&gt;%\n  filter(season &gt;= 2018,\n         game_type == \"REG\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nteam_games &lt;- games_clean %&gt;%\n  select(game_id, season, home_team, away_team, home_score, away_score) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    home_win = home_score &gt; away_score,\n    away_win = away_score &gt; home_score\n  )\n\nteam_wins &lt;- team_games %&gt;%\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(home_team, away_team),\n    names_to = \"location\",\n    values_to = \"team\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    win = case_when(\n      location == \"home_team\" & home_win ~ 1,\n      location == \"away_team\" & away_win ~ 1,\n      TRUE ~ 0\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(team, season) %&gt;%\n  summarize(wins = sum(win), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\npbp &lt;- nflreadr::load_pbp(2018:2024)\n\nteam_epa &lt;- pbp %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(epa), !is.na(posteam)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(season, team = posteam) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    mean_epa = mean(epa, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_epa = sum(epa, na.rm = TRUE),\n    plays = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nteam_stats &lt;- team_wins %&gt;%\n  left_join(team_epa, by = c(\"team\", \"season\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(team_stats, aes(x = mean_epa, y = wins)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Team EPA vs. Team Success (Wins)\",\n    x = \"Mean Offensive EPA\",\n    y = \"Wins\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nteam_games %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_games = n(),\n    home_win_rate = mean(home_win, na.rm = TRUE),\n    away_win_rate = mean(away_win, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  total_games home_win_rate away_win_rate\n        &lt;int&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        2127         0.539         0.457",

    "text": "This exploratory data analysis aims to find whether offensive or defensive efficiency is more important to team success and how performance in key game situations correlates with team success. Using nflreadR, which has a database of NFL statistics from the last 23 years, I created a ‘wins’ and ‘win_pct’ variable by creating an inequality function with home score and away score for each and team and then dividing that number by the total number of games in a football season. I then looked at EPA (Expected Points Added) for Offense and Defense and determined the correlation between each side’s EPA and win percentage to find that neither offense nor defense is more important for team success; Rather, they are equally important. The next item I wanted to look at was 3 metrics that are usually looked at as “key indicators of success:” Redzone efficiency, third down differential, and turnover margin. Redzone efficiency, or how often you score points when inside the 25 yard line, turned out to be the least correlated with win percentage with a correlation coefficient of only 0.37. Third down differential, a stat I created that weighs how often a team converts 3rd downs on offense while stopping their opponent, and turnover margin were similarly high in correlation with coefficients around 0.65, showing that improvement of performance in these situational metrics would correlate with more wins over the course of a season.\n\n\nCode\ndata.frame(\n  Metric = c(\"Offensive EPA\", \"Defensive EPA\", \"Off Third Down\", \"Def Third Down\"),\n  Correlation = c(\n    cor(team_data$off_epa, team_data$wins),\n    cor(team_data$def_epa, team_data$wins),\n    cor(team_data$off_third_down, team_data$wins),\n    cor(team_data$def_third_down, team_data$wins)\n  )\n) %&gt;% arrange(desc(abs(Correlation))) %&gt;% print()\n\n\n          Metric Correlation\n1  Offensive EPA   0.7104292\n2 Off Third Down   0.5978085\n3  Defensive EPA  -0.4581028\n4 Def Third Down  -0.2748840\n\n\nCode\ndata.frame(\n  Metric = c(\"Turnover Margin\", \"Third Down Differential\", \"Red Zone Differential\"),\n  Correlation = c(\n    cor(team_data$turnover_margin, team_data$wins),\n    cor(team_data$third_down_diff, team_data$wins),\n    cor(team_data$red_zone_diff, team_data$wins)\n  )\n) %&gt;% arrange(desc(abs(Correlation))) %&gt;% print()\n\n\n                   Metric Correlation\n1 Third Down Differential   0.6650562\n2         Turnover Margin   0.6115285\n3   Red Zone Differential   0.3747346\n\n\nCode\ncomparison_data &lt;- team_data %&gt;%\n  select(wins, off_epa, def_epa) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(off_epa, def_epa), names_to = \"metric\", values_to = \"epa\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(metric = ifelse(metric == \"off_epa\", \"Offense\", \"Defense\"))\n\nggplot(comparison_data, aes(x = epa, y = wins, color = metric)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.3, size = 1.5) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, linewidth = 1.2) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Offense\" = \"#2E7D32\", \"Defense\" = \"#C62828\"),\n    name = \"\"\n  ) +\n  labs(title = \"Offensive vs Defensive EPA: Predictive Power\",\n       subtitle = \"Which side of the ball better predicts team success?\",\n       x = \"EPA per Play (Defense: lower is better)\",\n       y = \"Wins\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\",\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsituational_data &lt;- team_data %&gt;%\n  select(wins, turnover_margin, third_down_diff, red_zone_diff) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -wins, names_to = \"metric\", values_to = \"value\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(metric = case_when(\n    metric == \"turnover_margin\" ~ \"Turnover Margin\",\n    metric == \"third_down_diff\" ~ \"Third Down Differential\",\n    metric == \"red_zone_diff\" ~ \"Red Zone Differential\"\n  ))\n\nggplot(situational_data, aes(x = value, y = wins)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, size = 1.5, color = \"#1976D2\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE, color = \"#0D47A1\", linewidth = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~metric, scales = \"free_x\", ncol = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Situational Factors and Team Success\",\n       subtitle = \"How turnovers, third downs, and red zone efficiency impact wins\",\n       x = \"Differential (Team - Opponent)\",\n       y = \"Wins\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n        strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 11))",

    "text": "Members: Christian Jones + Colin Mathews\nProject Description: This project aims to identify which American football statistics are most strongly associated with team success, as measured by overall record.\nResearch Questions:\n\nWhich team performance statistics are most strongly correlated with overall success in American football?\nAre offensive or defensive metrics more predictive of a team’s win–loss record?\nHow do situational factors (e.g., turnovers, third-down efficiency, red zone performance) influence a team’s likelihood of winning?\n\nProject Inspiration: Colin and I are both members of the Macalester College football team and share a strong interest in professional sports, both as athletes and as potential future career paths. This project gives us the opportunity to conduct research on a topic we’re passionate about—football performance and success—while also developing analytical and research skills that will strengthen our resumes and prepare us for potential careers in the sports industry.\nDataset: We are using the nflreadR and nflfastR packages in RStudio, which contain a wealth of team stats from the last 24 seasons.\nImplementation and Responsibility plan: This project will use publicly available NFL data from nflreadr to identify which team-level statistics best explain and predict game success between 2018–2024. The dataset will include team variables like total yards, passing yards, rushing yards, turnovers, and outcomes (win/loss, point differential). We may change these variables depending on what we talk about but we’re probably going to choose them using intuition. After cleaning and standardizing these features, we’ll perform some exploratory analysis and fit simple models to measure which stats most strongly influence winning probability. Results will be visualized through plots highlighting what we find to be key drivers in victory. The final project will hopefully communicate clear, data-backed insights into the fundamental factors that determine NFL team success.",

This report begins by explaining the data used — information from 75,000 shows in New York over three years. The report then examines bands that played at small venues, followed by medium venues, and finally big venues. It emphasizes the difficulty of “making it big” as a band. To present the data, the report uses short paragraphs for each venue size, but relies primarily on a visualization that updates as you scroll down the page. At the end, there is a final chart highlighting a select group of bands and how long it took them to achieve major success. Overall, we learned that while written descriptions of data findings are important, what truly captures a reader’s attention are visualizations—and when those visualizations can explain themselves, reader engagement and understanding improve significantly.",
