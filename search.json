    "text": "This exploratory data analysis investigates team-level NFL data from 2018–2024 using nflreadr/nflfastR. The goal is to examine which team statistics—such as offensive efficiency, defensive performance, and turnover margin—best relate to game success (wins). This EDA summarizes the data, checks for missingness, and provides early visual insights before building predictive models. This data originally consisted of NFL statistics ranging from 1999-2025, but given how much american football has evolved over 2 decades, it seems more appropriate to focus on statistics from 2018 to present. To explore this data, I cleaned it. Firstly filtering so stats begin during the 2018 season like mentioned, then filtering so the data only consists of regular season games. I did this to ensure each NFL franchise had a consistent amount of statistics. Using playoff stats as well could have altered the consistency, given that some franchises are more consistently good (making playoffs) and some are more consistently bad (missing playoffs). I then go onto looking at team and mean offensive EPA, which in simple terms is just how efficient and successful a team is on each given play (are they making the most of every play). Using my favorite team and my knowledge regarding their performance history, I found a strong correlation between EPA and team success. For example in 2021, the Detroit Lions lost 13 games, and only won 3; the team’s total EPA for that season was -85.239390 and the mean EPA was -0.06132330. For comparison, in 2024 the Lions won 15 games and only lost 2; the team’s total EPA for that season was 202.626047, with the mean EPA being 0.135084031. This comparison shows how strongly a team’s EPA reflects its overall success. In seasons where the Lions performed poorly, their total and mean EPA were deeply negative, indicating that the team was consistently losing value on a play-by-play basis. But in seasons where they won many more games, both their total and mean EPA were strongly positive. In short, higher EPA isn’t just a statistical improvement — it directly corresponds to better on-field performance and more wins.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ngames &lt;- load_schedules()\ngames_clean &lt;- games %&gt;%\n  filter(season &gt;= 2018,\n         game_type == \"REG\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nteam_games &lt;- games_clean %&gt;%\n  select(game_id, season, home_team, away_team, home_score, away_score) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    home_win = home_score &gt; away_score,\n    away_win = away_score &gt; home_score\n  )\n\nteam_wins &lt;- team_games %&gt;%\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(home_team, away_team),\n    names_to = \"location\",\n    values_to = \"team\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    win = case_when(\n      location == \"home_team\" & home_win ~ 1,\n      location == \"away_team\" & away_win ~ 1,\n      TRUE ~ 0\n    )\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(team, season) %&gt;%\n  summarize(wins = sum(win), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\npbp &lt;- nflreadr::load_pbp(2018:2024)\n\nteam_epa &lt;- pbp %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(epa), !is.na(posteam)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(season, team = posteam) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    mean_epa = mean(epa, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_epa = sum(epa, na.rm = TRUE),\n    plays = n(),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\nteam_stats &lt;- team_wins %&gt;%\n  left_join(team_epa, by = c(\"team\", \"season\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(team_stats, aes(x = mean_epa, y = wins)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Team EPA vs. Team Success (Wins)\",\n    x = \"Mean Offensive EPA\",\n    y = \"Wins\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nteam_games %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    total_games = n(),\n    home_win_rate = mean(home_win, na.rm = TRUE),\n    away_win_rate = mean(away_win, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  total_games home_win_rate away_win_rate\n        &lt;int&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        2127         0.539         0.457",

    "text": "Members: Christian Jones + Colin Mathews\nProject Description: This project aims to identify which American football statistics are most strongly associated with team success, as measured by overall record.\nResearch Questions:\n\nWhich team performance statistics are most strongly correlated with overall success in American football?\nAre offensive or defensive metrics more predictive of a team’s win–loss record?\nHow do situational factors (e.g., turnovers, third-down efficiency, red zone performance) influence a team’s likelihood of winning?\n\nProject Inspiration: Colin and I are both members of the Macalester College football team and share a strong interest in professional sports, both as athletes and as potential future career paths. This project gives us the opportunity to conduct research on a topic we’re passionate about—football performance and success—while also developing analytical and research skills that will strengthen our resumes and prepare us for potential careers in the sports industry.\nDataset: We are using the nflreadR and nflfastR packages in RStudio, which contain a wealth of team stats from the last 24 seasons.\nImplementation and Responsibility plan: This project will use publicly available NFL data from nflreadr to identify which team-level statistics best explain and predict game success between 2018–2024. The dataset will include team variables like total yards, passing yards, rushing yards, turnovers, and outcomes (win/loss, point differential). We may change these variables depending on what we talk about but we’re probably going to choose them using intuition. After cleaning and standardizing these features, we’ll perform some exploratory analysis and fit simple models to measure which stats most strongly influence winning probability. Results will be visualized through plots highlighting what we find to be key drivers in victory. The final project will hopefully communicate clear, data-backed insights into the fundamental factors that determine NFL team success.",

    "text": "The professional report we decided to study was “Making it Big” (https://pudding.cool/2017/01/making-it-big/), which explores the trajectory of bands. This report begins by explaining the data used — information from 75,000 shows in New York over three years. The report then examines bands that played at small venues, followed by medium venues, and finally big venues. It emphasizes the difficulty of “making it big” as a band. To present the data, the report uses short paragraphs for each venue size, but relies primarily on a visualization that updates as you scroll down the page. At the end, there is a final chart highlighting a select group of bands and how long it took them to achieve major success. Overall, we learned that while written descriptions of data findings are important, what truly captures a reader’s attention are visualizations—and when those visualizations can explain themselves, reader engagement and understanding improve significantly.",
